##############
In Docker file:
    we have two main parameter in Dockerfile-
        CMD : when a container is started, this is the command which will get excuted but it is hardcoded in image. below formats are acceptable:
              CMD <executable binary> [parameter] (e.g. CMD sleep 10)
              OR
              CMD ["<executable binary>", "parameter"] (e.g. CMD ["sleep","10"] )
              In this case, CMD instructions can be replaced entirely.
        entrypoint: this is command will be executable when the continer get started but will take precendence over CMD. In this case, command line parameter will get appended.
               ENTRYPOINT ["executable binary"] (e.g. ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]) (and if it is expecting some arguments then we can pass while launching the container)
               e.g.:
               # docker run <image_name> [parameter]
               (# docker run ubuntu 5) (here we are considering that sleep is defined as entrypoint in image)

               --> Dockerfile
                    FROM ubuntu
                    ENTRYPOINT ["sleep"]
                    CMD ["5"]

                (by default, it will run sleep command for 5 second but if we want to change it then can pass it while launching container)
                # docker run ubuntu 10

                --> still, we can override the entrypoint with command line:
                # docker run --entrypoint <another executable binary>  <image_name>  [parameter]

In kubernetes Yaml file:
    If we need to pass the same command and entrypoint instructions in yaml file, then we can define as below:
    command: ["Binary"] (is equilant to entrypoint)
    args:["< >"] (is equilant to CMD)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
    e.g:
    in spec section, under container section where image is mentioned, we can define this:
    command:["sleep"]
    args: ["10"]
    
    OR (we can pass as an array:
    command:
        - "sleep"
        - "10"
    
    OR
    command: ["sleep", "10"]

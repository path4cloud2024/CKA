# 🚀 CKA Beginner’s Guide (Step-by-Step Roadmap)

## 📌 1. Kubernetes Basics
Before diving deep, understand what Kubernetes is and why it’s used.
- **What is Kubernetes?** → Container orchestration platform.
- **Why use it?** → Automates deployment, scaling, networking, and management of containers.
- **Basic Terms:** Pod, Node, Cluster, Control Plane, Worker Node.

👉 Start with:
- A simple Pod YAML (like Nginx).
- Run `kubectl get/describe/logs/exec`.

---

## 📌 2. Kubernetes Architecture
Understand the components:
- **Control Plane:** API Server, etcd, Controller Manager, Scheduler.
- **Worker Node:** kubelet, kube-proxy, container runtime.
- **Pod → Deployment → Service → Ingress.**

👉 Visualize: Control Plane = brain 🧠, Worker Nodes = muscles 💪.

---

## 📌 3. Workloads & Scheduling
- **Pods** → Smallest deployable unit.
- **ReplicaSets & Deployments** → Scaling & self-healing.
- **DaemonSets** → Run one pod per node.
- **Jobs & CronJobs** → Batch tasks.
- **Scheduler** → How pods get placed on nodes.

👉 Practice scaling an app:
```bash
kubectl scale deployment nginx-deployment --replicas=3
```

---

## 📌 4. Services & Networking
- **ClusterIP** → Internal service.
- **NodePort** → Expose service on node’s IP.
- **LoadBalancer** → Cloud external access.
- **Ingress** → Advanced routing (HTTP/HTTPS).
- **CoreDNS** → Service discovery.

👉 Know difference: Pod IP vs Service IP vs NodePort.

---

## 📌 5. Storage & Volumes
- **emptyDir** → Temporary storage.
- **hostPath** → Node filesystem.
- **PersistentVolume (PV) & PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** → Cluster storage.
- **StorageClass** → Dynamic provisioning.

👉 Practice mounting a PVC to Nginx pod.

---

## 📌 6. Security
- **Namespaces** → Logical separation.
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** → Who can do what.
- **Service Accounts** → Identity for pods.
- **Secrets & ConfigMaps** → Store credentials/config.
- **Network Policies** → Control pod-to-pod traffic.

---

## 📌 7. Cluster Maintenance
- Upgrade cluster components.
- Backup & restore etcd.
- Drain & cordon nodes.
- Manage kubeconfig.

---

## 📌 8. Logging & Monitoring
- `kubectl logs` → Pod logs.
- `kubectl describe` → Events.
- **Metrics Server** → Resource usage.
- Tools: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK.

---

## 📌 9. Troubleshooting (Most Important for CKA)
- Pod stuck in **CrashLoopBackOff** → Check logs, events.
- Service not reachable → Check endpoints, kube-proxy.
- Node not ready → Check kubelet, runtime.
- DNS not working → Check CoreDNS.

👉 Practice: `kubectl describe`, `kubectl logs`, `kubectl exec`, `kubectl get events`.

---

## 📌 10. Hands-on Practice (Key to Pass CKA)
- Create/delete/scale pods, deployments.
- Expose services.
- Manage configmaps/secrets.
- Set resource requests/limits.
- Backup etcd.
- Troubleshoot broken YAMLs.

## 🧾 Beginner-Friendly Study Plan (Daily 1–2 hrs)
- ✅ **Week 1** → Basics, Architecture, Pods, Deployments
- ✅ **Week 2** → Services, Networking, Storage
- ✅ **Week 3** → Security (RBAC, Secrets, ConfigMaps)
- ✅ **Week 4** → Maintenance, Logging, Troubleshooting
- ✅ **Week 5** → Mock CKA practice tests (Lightning Labs)

## 📚 Recommended Free Resources
- [Kubernetes.io Docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/) (official, best source).
- [Killer.sh simulator](https://killer.sh) (for practice exams).
- “CKA Lightning Labs” on GitHub (hands-on practice).

---

## ⚡ Pro Tip for CKA:
- The exam is **hands-on** (no multiple choice).
- You need to **solve tasks in a live cluster**.
- Be very comfortable with `kubectl` commands and YAMLs.
- **Time management is critical.**
